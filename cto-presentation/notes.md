Cool stuff we built

* Snarky v1 -- and we used it to build a whole proof of stake blockchain
* Recursive modular proof system -- with folding, chunking, ramlookup -> zkvm support, etc
* First implementation of ouroboros (we beat cardano and ours was in a snark)
* o1js -- the most usable zk sdk (now with custom gates!)
* A standard library with cool treats like a powerful nullifier
* zkApp CLI, mina signer,
* Staged ledger
* Deployment and testing infrastructure
    * Cloud infrastructure that can run testnets
    * Protocol Testing framework built on top
    * Cut down spend
    * Deploys 
    * Nightly CI
    * Lightnet (for o1js local testing)

Where hats!

Please tell me your ideas -- I want to spend time inward. Include actions! We tend to talk about alot of good things during the offsite, but typically we end up saying the same things everytime. How do we change it?
