* Title: Unlocking the zk endgame
* zk everything
    ...
* It'd be like a zk rollup, but fully decentralized
    * decentralized proving + decentralized sequencing
* We'd have a proof of everything
    * A proof that recursively composes with any arbitrary stuff
* people would be able to prove stuff locally -- extreme edge compute
    * full privacy, predictable gas consumption (not proportional to compute)
* a sophisticated custom zk application model that handles these edge-compute races, supports off-chain contract composition, custom token, and fine-grained permissioning system

* I'm shilling Mina, payments on mainnet for a while.
    * Initial smart contracts release hardforked on Devent successfully yesterday

    * But a zk rollup that can do anything
* Proof of Everything
    * There exists a proof of the block before, an aggregated proof of transactions from some older blocks, and a bunch of other stuff
    * Such that: the proof verifies, the other stuff obeys consensus rules, and the aggregated proof is real
* Decentralized everything
* Decentralized sequencing
    * 
* Devnet is hardforking yesterday (Apr 9)




* Recursive modular proof system -- with folding, chunking, ramlookup -> zkvm support, etc
* First implementation of ouroboros (we beat cardano and ours was in a snark)
* o1js -- the most usable zk sdk (now with custom gates!)
* A standard library with cool treats like a powerful nullifier
* Staged ledger

Imagine you had the ultimate zk platform

What might you want?
1. Some kind of mechanism for interacting with global shared state (typically a "blockchain")
2. Building composably on top of the shoulders of others through said shared state 
3. Developers can actually use the zk powers of the proof system â€” they donâ€™t want to learn a new programming language. Something jacascripty. Maybe for some chunks they want to use standard Go or Rust through a riscv, mips, or wasm zkVM. But also they want the power to go deeper.
1. Scale through L2/3/4/5/6/7/infinity

And holding what properties?
1. Decentralization?
2. Privacy?
3. Computational efficiency?
4. Easy Composability?
5. Scaling


(and why for each)


How for each:

Decentralization1: decentralized sequencing â€” some kind of consensus algorithm
Decentralization3: weâ€™d want as many network participants as we can to work with consumer hardware â€” so break up the work into little pieces (split blocks with txns and even chunks of txns)
Decentrlization2: decentralized proving â€” some kind of system for farming proofs to a marketplace â€” hereâ€™s how it could workâ€¦ (pull from other deck)
Decentralization4: weâ€™d want users to interact with applications without some centralized middleware and without sacrificing trustlessness â€¦ and so we need a proof of everything â€¦
â€¦decentralization1.5: that means we need this in a snark, for tricky bits like a VRF calculation that calls for real numbers we can use a Taylor series approximation 

Composability1: okay so composability is nice because you can mix and match and reuse logic,
What is composability? Itâ€™s building complex things out of LEGOs that can plug into
You need the ability to loop
Recursion needs to be first class for devs, and unbounded for ultimate power -- aggregate inside yourself
Composability2: in addition to recursion as a way of combining, we should be able to call smart contracts from other contracts. This is part of the power of web3 platforms like Ethereum 
Hereâ€™s how that might workâ€¦.

Privacy: we need to run compute locally on the far edge, and so we should manage race conditions. Hereâ€™s how that might workâ€¦
Computational efficiency: run compute locally, on the far edge. Services can evaporate if users run their own compute. Gas is predictable.

Anyway, all that is Mina â€” if you knew me ahead of time you probably knew I was shilling , but hopefully I surprised some of you

On Mina mainnet for last 3+ yrs:
â€¢ proof of everything (for payments) using pickled kimchi proof system (plonkish halo2ish w/ IPA over pasta IPA)
â€¢ Decentralized sequencing (ouroboros in a snark)
â€¢ Decentralized proving (snarketplace)

On Mina mainnet soon (Devnet hf-ed successfully):
â€¢ client-side computation with zkApps , and composable through call forests
â€¢ no middleware, all users connect directly to zkApps -> browser node=open-mina
* programmable with o1js , iterating with devs for over 2yrs on a typescript/javascript framework for working with circuits and has first class recursion and ability to use custom gates ;; ecosystem of many devs, cool libs like ecdsa and nullifiers etc.
â€¢ Mina blockchain proof of everything zk state bridging to evm (nil or Lambdaclass or via alignedlayer)
â€¢ Some zk Rollups and zk sdks (protokit / zeko)

And on mainnet later:
â€¢ integrate zkVM (o1Labs has grafted a high performance one inside kimchi) into zkApps 
â€¢ More performance
â€¢ more proof system customization per app, but still rolling up into Mina
â€¢ More bridges
â€¢ More L2s and app chains 


Check it out, we hardforked Devnet successfully yesterdayâ€”mainnet hardfork up next, stay tuned ðŸŽ¶

I expect Mina will be the first general purpose programmable zk L1 or L2 where you can actually tap into the underlying proof system, use recursion, custom gates, etcâ€¦

Weâ€™re hiring for loads of roles , and if youâ€™re special we can bend a role to fit you. 

Conclusion CTA: â€¦tell folks to check out o1js? And join the Mina Discord?  Tell them:  If youâ€™re already part of the Mina ecosystem, you should be already getting ready for the big upgrade.  If youâ€™re another chain that wishes it had verifiable compute, check out Mina as a modular layer for your chain.
